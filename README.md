# Mindmaps 4 Internet

Mindmaps in your web browser. So you can use it in your mobile phone. Or in your desktop computer.

[Here is an app](https://lborgman.github.io/mm4i/mm4i.html) for that.
No installation required. Since it is a web page.


## Background
Ever since I first saw mindmaps in practical use I have wanted to use it myself. 
But. It looked like you needed a big paper. 
Or rather several to redraw the mindmap. 

Putting the mindmap in a computer could be a good idea, I thought.
And then, preferably the computer I always bring with me, my mobile.
