# Mindmaps 4 Internet

Mindmaps in your web browser. So you can use it in your mobile phone. Or in your desktop computer.

[Here is an app](https://lborgman.github.io/mm4i/mm4i.html) for that.
No installation required. Since it is a web page.


## Background
Ever since I first saw mindmaps in practical use I have wanted to use it myself. 
But. It looked like you needed a big paper. 
Or rather several to redraw the mindmap. 

Putting the mindmap in a computer could be a good idea, I thought.
And then, preferably the computer I always bring with me, my mobile.


## Acknowledgement

First of all I would not have written **MM4I** (Mindmaps for Internet)
if [Zhigang Zhang](https://github.com/hizzgdev) had not written **jsmind**. 
I was looking for mindmap software that ran in the web browser.
The only mindmap software I found was jsmind.
It ran quite nicely in a web browser on a desktop PC using a mouse.
However it did not work in my mobile (Android, of course).

So I thought I should just fix that... 

It was far more work than I expected.
But also difficult sometimes, which made it more fun.

I strived a bit to make it easy to move nodes in a mindmap.
Zhigang came up with a nice idea which I decided to use.

Using a touch screen instead of a mouse is a challenge.
**jssm** helped a lot when I struggled to implement that.

I did add some things to try to give MM4I the "feel" of a mindmap.
Colors, shape etc.
And notes for nodes - which I think is a natural addition for a computer
based mindmap.
